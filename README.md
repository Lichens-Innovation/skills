# Artificial Intelligence Lichens Tools

Lichens Innovation repository for **AI-assisted development tools** — a single place for rules, agents, skills, MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, and any other artifacts that enhance coding with AI (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, etc.). This repo started with Agent Skills and has grown to cover the full spectrum of configurable AI dev tooling. For the skills timeline and ecosystem evolution, see [skills history](./SKILLS-HISTORY.md).

## Installation

From a project or any directory:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/Lichens-Innovation/skills
```

Or using the short form:

```bash
npx skills add Lichens-Innovation/skills
```

**Useful options:**

- **Project** (default): skills are installed in the project (e.g. `.agents/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`) and can be versioned with the repo.
- **Global**: `npx skills add Lichens-Innovation/skills -g` — available across all your projects.
- **Target agents**: `npx skills add Lichens-Innovation/skills -a cursor -a github-copilot -a claude-code`.
- **List skills** without installing: `npx skills add Lichens-Innovation/skills --list`.

## Validating skills

You can validate that a skill’s `SKILL.md` frontmatter and structure follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) using [skills-ref](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills/tree/main/skills-ref). From the root of this repository:

```bash
# Validate a specific skill (e.g. react-ts-guidelines)
skills-ref validate ./skills/react-ts-guidelines

# Validate all skills in the repo (if you have multiple skills)
skills-ref validate ./skills
```

Install `skills-ref` according to the [agentskills repo](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills). This checks that `name`, `description`, and optional fields comply with the spec and that the skill directory structure is valid.

## How a skill becomes active (Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code)

1. **Installation**  
   The `npx skills add` command uses the [open agent skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills). It fetches this repo and copies each skill (folder containing a `SKILL.md` and its files) into the directories expected by each tool:
   - **Cursor**: `.agents/skills/` (project) or `~/.cursor/skills/` (global)
   - **GitHub Copilot**: `.agents/skills/` (project) or `~/.copilot/skills/` (global)
   - **Claude Code**: `.claude/skills/` (project) or `~/.claude/skills/` (global)

2. **Discovery by the agent**  
   Cursor, Copilot, and Claude Code scan these directories and load the `SKILL.md` files (name, description, instructions). They follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io).

3. **Skill activation**  
   When your question or request matches the **usage context** described in the skill (e.g. “When to use”, description), the agent injects that skill into context and follows its **Instructions**. The skill is therefore active whenever it is relevant, with no extra action on your part.

In short: **install** → **files in the right place** → **the agent reads and applies the skill when relevant**.
